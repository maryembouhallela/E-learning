# E-Learning App

A comprehensive e-learning application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). This platform allows students and teachers to interact seamlessly, manage courses, and track progress. 

## Project Setup

### Frontend (React)

1. **Initialize React Project**: Run `npx create-react-app .` to create your React application. Start the development server using `npm start`. 

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install ES7 snippets and HTML to JSX conversion tools in your code editor. Install React Router for routing using `npm install react-router-dom`, and Axios for making HTTP requests with `npm install axios`. 

3. **Routing**: Set up routes in a dedicated `router/routes` directory, specifying the paths for your components.

### Backend (Node.js)

1. **Initialize Node.js Project**: Use `npm init -y` to create a `package.json` file for your Node.js application.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Install HTTP to create a server using `npm install http`. Use JSON Web Token for authentication with `npm install jsonwebtoken`. Manage environment variables by installing dotenv with `npm install dotenv`. Use Mailtrap for sending emails (for password reset) with `npm install mailtrap`, and enable CORS to handle cross-origin requests with `npm install cors`.

3. **Project Structure**: Follow a pattern of `model -> controller -> route -> server`. Implement authentication with token management, including fresh tokens.

4. **Local Storage**: Utilize local storage for saving application state or user information.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration for both students and teachers.
- **Course Management**: Create, update, and delete courses.
- **Progress Tracking**: Students can track their learning progress.
- **Interactive Learning**: Features like quizzes, assignments, and discussion boards.
- **Real-Time Notifications**: Get notified of new courses, assignments, and deadlines.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, Redux, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT for authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Other Tools**: Cloudinary (for image storage), Socket.io (for real-time communication)
